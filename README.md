# nvim-air

A small, fast Neovim packaged with Nix. Not a config you copy into
`~/.config/nvim` — a flake that produces one self-contained binary with
every plugin, language server, linter and formatter already inside it.

Clone it, run `nix run`, and you have a working editor. Nothing to install,
nothing to bootstrap on first launch, no plugin manager downloading half of
GitHub while you wait.

## Why this exists

Most Neovim setups install a plugin manager which then fetches plugins at
runtime, and expect you to install language servers separately with your
system package manager. That leaves two moving parts that drift apart: the
config assumes tools that may not be there.

Here, Nix builds everything together. The plugins, the language servers,
the formatters and the CLI tools are pinned in one lockfile and end up on
the editor's own `PATH`. The same commit produces the same editor on any
machine — and uninstalling is deleting one symlink.

The design goal is **lightness**. The target profile is Nix, Bash and
Markdown daily, Lua occasionally; anything heavier is behind a flag that is
off by default. Every plugin is lazy-loaded on a trigger, so nothing that
goes unused costs startup time.

## Quick start

You need [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) with flakes enabled.

```sh
# Try it without installing anything
nix run github:<user>/nvim-air

# Or build it and get ./result/bin/nvim
nix build github:<user>/nvim-air
```

## Installing

The binary is called `nvim`, with `nvim-air` and `nv` as aliases.

### NixOS

```nix
{
  inputs.nvim-air.url = "github:<user>/nvim-air";

  # in your system configuration
  imports = [ inputs.nvim-air.nixosModules.default ];
  wrappers.nvim-air.enable = true;
}
```

### Home Manager

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.nvim-air.homeModules.default ];
  wrappers.nvim-air.enable = true;
}
```

### As an overlay

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.nvim-air.overlays.default ];
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.nvim-air ];
```

### Configuring it

Every option lives under `wrappers.nvim-air.settings`:

```nix
wrappers.nvim-air = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    markdown.line_length = 80;
    obsidian.vault = "~/notes";
    langs.python.enable = true;
  };
};
```

See [Options](#options) for the full list.

## What's inside

Neovim 0.12 plus the following. Everything is lazy-loaded: plugins load on
a filetype, a command, a keypress or an event, never at startup unless they
have to be.

**Interface** — [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
statusline, [alpha](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim) dashboard,
[fidget](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim) for LSP progress,
[web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons),
[colorizer](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua) for inline hex
colours, [todo-comments](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim).

**Files and search** — [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim)
edits the filesystem as if it were a buffer,
[telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) with the
native fzf sorter and `ui-select` for fuzzy finding everything else.

**Editing** — [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround),
[autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs),
[spectre](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre) for search-and-replace
across a project, [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree),
[actions-preview](https://github.com/aznhe21/actions-preview.nvim),
[vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) for indentation
detection.

**Git** — [gitsigns](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) with
inline blame, [lazygit](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim) for the
full UI, [diffview](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim) for diffs
and file history.

**Language support** — `nvim-lspconfig` with servers for Nix
([nixd](https://github.com/nix-community/nixd)), Lua
(`lua-language-server`) and Markdown
([rumdl](https://github.com/rvben/rumdl)) always on, plus optional Python
and web servers. [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint)
runs `shellcheck`, `selene`, `statix` and `deadnix`;
[conform](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim) formats on save with
`stylua`, `shfmt`, `nixfmt` and `rumdl`.

**Completion** — [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) with LSP,
snippet, path and buffer sources, command-line completion, and
[LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) with `friendly-snippets`.

**Treesitter** — grammars are built by Nix, never compiled at runtime, so
there is no C toolchain in the closure. Provides precise highlighting,
folds, indentation and textobjects.

**Markdown** —
[render-markdown](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim)
renders headings, code blocks, tables and checkboxes in the buffer;
[image.nvim](https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim) shows images inline in
terminals that support the kitty graphics protocol (kitty, WezTerm).

**Optional** —
[obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim) for note
taking, [CodeCompanion](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim)
for in-editor AI chat.

### CLI tools on the editor's PATH

`ripgrep`, `fd`, `lazygit`, `imagemagick`, `fortune`, `cowsay`, `nixd`,
`nixfmt`, `statix`, `deadnix`, `shellcheck`, `shfmt`,
`lua-language-server`, `stylua`, `selene`, `rumdl`.

They are visible to the editor only — they do not leak into your shell.

## Features worth knowing about

### Markdown is the centre of gravity

Wrapping is handled internally rather than by an external formatter.
`textwidth` wraps as you type, and on save the prose is reflowed one
Treesitter node at a time, so code blocks, tables and headings are left
alone and nested list indentation survives. `:MdWrap` does it on demand.

Style rules come from `rumdl`, which acts as a language server, a fixer,
and a formatter. The rules are generated by Nix into the store, not read
from a project `.rumdl.toml` — which means they apply in every directory,
not just inside this repository.

### Spell checking is opt-in

Off everywhere until you ask for it. `:SpellToggle` or `<leader>z` turns it
on for the current buffer and the current session only — nothing is written
to disk.

Italian and English are checked at once by default: a word passes if any
dictionary contains it, so mixed-language notes work. Code is never checked
— fenced blocks, indented blocks and inline `` `code` `` are all excluded,
as are URLs and link targets.

Vim's own spell keys apply: `z=` for suggestions, `zg` to add a word, `]s`
and `[s` to jump between mistakes.

The dictionaries are binary `.spl` files checked into `spell/`, so the
build stays reproducible and works offline. Only `.spl` is shipped: the
companion `.sug` suggestion caches were dropped because `z=` derives
suggestions from the `.spl` itself and the Italian cache alone weighed
19 MB.

To add a language, drop its `.spl` next to the others and add the code to
`spell.languages`. Vim's git repository only publishes English under
`runtime/spell/`; every other language lives on the Vim FTP mirrors:

```bash
curl -fL -o spell/en.utf-8.spl \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vim/vim/master/runtime/spell/en.utf-8.spl
curl -fL -o spell/it.utf-8.spl \
  https://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/vim/runtime/spell/it.utf-8.spl

head -c 8 spell/it.utf-8.spl   # a valid file starts with VIMspell
```

Keep the `-f`: without it a 404 is written into the file as an HTML error
page and Neovim fails with `E757: This does not look like a spell file`.

### Nothing loads until it is used

Every plugin declares a trigger — a filetype, a command, a keymap or an
event. Opening a Bash script does not load the Markdown renderer, and the
note-taking plugin stays out of the build entirely unless you set a vault
path.

`:LzeStatus` shows which plugins are installed and which are currently
loaded. `:LzeNix` shows what the Nix wrapper handed to the Lua side.

### It still works outside Nix

The Lua config degrades gracefully. Outside the wrapper, the Nix bridge is
replaced by a stub that returns defaults, so the config can be read and run
as an ordinary Neovim setup.

### The palette follows the desktop

The colours come from `lua/plugins/dankcolors.lua`, a base16 theme
generated by [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankLinux-Docs),
the Quickshell desktop suite whose dynamic theming is powered by `matugen`
and derives its palette from the wallpaper.

That file is the one part of the config deliberately **not** read from the
Nix store. `init.lua` loads it from `stdpath("config")` — the live
`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/dankcolors.lua` the shell rewrites — and
translates its lazy.nvim syntax to an `lze` spec on the fly. The file
registers a filesystem watcher on itself, so changing the wallpaper
recolours an editor that is already open, with no restart. Everything else
stays pinned in the store; only the palette is allowed to move.

The copy tracked in this repository is the fallback for anyone not running
the shell. Replace it with any colorscheme you like: keep the file name,
since `init.lua` looks it up by name, and give it a `config` function that
sets up your theme.

### External programs

`vim.ui.open` is what Neovim calls to hand a file or URL to another program
— `gx`, markdown links, `gx` inside oil. Every handler defaults to empty,
which leaves Neovim's own behaviour in place: it falls back to `xdg-open`
and your desktop associations decide.

Override only what you want:

```nix
settings.open = {
  browser = "firefox";
  pdf     = "zathura";
  image   = "imv";
  video   = "mpv";

  # A directory needs both: xdg-open can reach a graphical file
  # manager but never a terminal one.
  terminal    = "wezterm start --";
  filemanager = "yazi";
};
```

### AI adapters

`ai.adapter` accepts any CodeCompanion adapter. They come in two kinds:

- **API key** — `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `mistral`,
  `ollama` and others read a key from the environment.
- **Subscription** — `copilot`, `claude_code`, `gemini_cli`, `codex` and
  other ACP adapters reuse a CLI you have already signed into, so no API
  key is involved.

The default is `copilot`. No credential is stored in this repository.

## Keybindings

`<leader>` and `<localleader>` are both `\` (backslash).

| Key         | Mode    | Action                        |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `H` / `L`   | n, x, o | Start / end of line           |
| `-`         | n       | Open oil in a floating window |
| `<leader>u` | n       | Toggle the undo tree          |
| `<leader>z` | n       | Toggle spell checking         |

**Search** — `<leader>s` is the telescope prefix: `sf` files, `sg` grep,
`sw` word under cursor, `sb` buffers, `sh` help, `sk` keymaps, `sd`
diagnostics, `sr` resume, `s.` recent, `sn` config files. `<leader>/`
searches the current buffer, `<leader><leader>` lists buffers. Uppercase
goes to spectre: `<leader>S` toggle, `sR` replace across the project, `sF`
in the current file.

**Git** — `<leader>gg` lazygit, `gd` open diffview, `gq` close it, `gh`
file history, `gc` commits, `gs` status, `gb` branches.

**LSP** (only in buffers with a server attached) — `gd` definition, `gD`
declaration, `gr` references, `gI` implementation, `K` hover, `<C-k>`
signature, `<leader>rn` rename, `<leader>ca` code actions, `<leader>e` show
diagnostic, `<leader>ds` document symbols, `<leader>ws` workspace symbols.

**Treesitter textobjects** — `am` / `im` function, `ac` / `ic` class, `as`
local scope. `<leader>ps` and `<leader>pS` swap parameters.

**Markdown** — in visual mode the selection can be wrapped in place:
`<C-b>` for `**bold**`, `<C-i>` for `*italic*` and ``<C-`>`` for
`` `code` ``. For anything else, nvim-surround's `S` wraps a selection in
any delimiter.

Two terminal quirks worth knowing. `<C-i>` and `<Tab>` are the same byte,
so Tab italicises too. ``<C-`>`` is not an ASCII control code and only
reaches Neovim from terminals speaking the kitty keyboard protocol (kitty,
WezTerm, Ghostty, foot); anywhere else use `S`. `<C-[>` is deliberately
unmapped: it is byte-identical to Escape.

**Notes** (when a vault is set) — `<leader>o` is the obsidian prefix: `oo`
open, `on` new note, `os` search, `ob` backlinks, `ot` template, `od`
dailies.

**AI** (when enabled) — `<C-s>` actions, `<leader>a` toggle chat, `ga` in
visual adds the selection to the chat.

## Layout

```text
flake.nix            # inputs and outputs
module.nix           # feature flags, plugins, packages
init.lua             # bootstrap: lze handlers, spec loading

lua/core/            # options, keymaps, autocmds, markdown wrap,
                     # spell, theme, shared paths
lua/plugins/         # one file per area, each returning lze specs
lua/tools/           # user commands: external open, lze debugging

queries/             # Treesitter query overrides
spell/               # binary .spl dictionaries, checked in
selene.toml          # lua lint config; vim.toml holds its std
```

Adding a plugin takes two steps: declare it in `module.nix` so Nix builds
it, then write its spec in `lua/plugins/`.

## Development

```sh
nix build                                  # build the package
nix run                                    # launch the editor
nix flake check
nix flake update                           # refresh the lockfile

selene init.lua lua/                       # lint lua
nixfmt module.nix flake.nix                # format nix
nix path-info --closure-size -h .#default  # measure the build
```

Flakes only copy git-tracked files into the store, so **run `git add`
before rebuilding after creating a file** — otherwise the new module is
missing from the package and the editor starts with
`module '...' not found`.

## Notes

- Some binaries deliberately come from the host rather than the build:
  `git`, and whatever you point the `open.*` handlers at.
- `lua/plugins/dankcolors.lua` is generated by DankMaterialShell and loaded
  separately from the other specs — see [The palette follows the
  desktop](#the-palette-follows-the-desktop).
- `exrc` is on, so project-local `.nvim.lua` files are executed.
- The clipboard is synced with the system via `unnamedplus`.
